# Shadowbounce

This was projects 1 and 2 from Semester 2 2019 of Object Oriented Software Design (SWEN20003).

The goal was to build an arcade game similar to Peggles using Java. The first project was to implement basic physics and game functionality, while the second expanded into a fully realised game.

The game utilises the `bagel` package, which was built specifically for the project by the head tutor in order to build our game from.

Running the game:

You can load this via IntelliJ or any interactive Java environment from the root folder `ShadowBounce`.

You can run `ShadowBounce.java` inside the `src/main` folder.
